# hello-world
My name is Emanuel Hongu Flaviu.
I am a High School student who is learning programming.
I will push the code I make here because this site can help me learn faster and better.
I will also ask a lot of questions in order for me to learn.
I want to become a great programmer and eventually program AIs or proceduraly generated things.
Actually I have already tried programming before, but never finished anything except for the one project I published yesterday: Epikiklos.
With this repository I want to learn how to use GitHub, and maybe start some discussions to learn more.
